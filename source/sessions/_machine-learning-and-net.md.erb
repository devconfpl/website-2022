ML.NET is still fairly fresh Microsoft venture into deep learning. It's written 
in .NET Core and a lot of good thinking went into it. It's definitely the best 
hope for .NET developers to do machine learning natively and easily incorporate 
it into existing apps. CNTK is another venture into ML for Microsoft, that 
allows you better control over what you're doing.

And to show the power of both of them, we'll harness deep learning to help a 
metal band to get out of their rut by writing for them some awesome new riffs. 

From this talk, you'll learn how to use ML.NET and CNTK, how some deep 
learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks work and how to write 
a metal songs!
