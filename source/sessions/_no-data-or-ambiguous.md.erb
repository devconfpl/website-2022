We all know how frustrating it is for data engineers to implement constant changes due to unclear and
ambiguous requirements, lack of resources or technologies we would like to have, and low quality or
complete absence of data to use.

For some of these factors, we will not have an immediate solution. Fortunately, we have tools that may
help us on this bumpy ride. One of these tools can be BDD, Behavior Driven Development. We can use it
to make requirements more transparent, develop features without access to accurate data examples,
and protect our sanity. As a cherry on the top of a pie, it should make your client more involved and take
ownership of things they request from you.

During my presentation, we will cover basic information about BDD and Behave python library, how it
can help you define your tasks and structure your code, or even build and test your solution without
access to data.
