During this talk, I will give an overview of how ThreeJS works and show you how to bring 3D into the browser in a powerful and creative way.
A first step would be to create a simple object, then see what steps are involved to re-create a (realistic) visual to sparkle a nice 3D experience to your visitors. A lot of inspiration will be given, as well as resources to go deeper into the field if the audience wants to go further!
