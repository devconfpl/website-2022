WCF may be no more, but there are still countless legacy systems that only 
speak SOAP, and new code still needs to talk to them. As part of the 
Visual Recode project, we're providing a brand new SOAP client generator 
for .NET Core 3.0; one that uses the full range of new, high-performance 
features of the modern framework. We've got Pipelines, Channels, Buffers, 
Pools, Spans, the works. In this talk, I'll show you how it all works 
together to create a client that uses less than 1% of the memory used 
by the old WCF client, and how you can use these new components to improve 
your own projects at all levels.
