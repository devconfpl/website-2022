Every day we are affected by technological progress. Industries gained efficiency and productivity, due to the introduction of technologies with entirely new ways of serving existing needs. Smartphones, tablets, and other devices have become embedded and integrated into our daily lives, making us ever more disconnected from reality.

However, in every society, geography and culture determine the nature of technological development. Therefore, places without computers and the internet still exist, places where you feel like you're back in time for almost a whole century.

She learned how people used to communicate, solve problems, and build their life before the world went online. Join Olena for an insightful look at the difference between these two worlds with an attainment gap of almost a century. We will talk about digital transformation, technological revolutions, and the innovative features of Azure supporting them.
