Callum will share the process followed and challenges faced from incrementally 
rewriting a large monolithic medical system (used by the NHS and other global 
health institutions) into a majestically constructed microservices architecture.

He’ll discuss how the team identified, prioritised and replaced key components 
of an existing application as independent services; the difficulty but importance 
of refactoring the legacy codebase to be event oriented, methods used to 
effectively “strangle” parts of the live system as they were replaced, and what 
the team needed to do to rapidly scale up a creaking system against a tight 
Christmas deadline…

He will also take a look at the infrastructure components used to quickly get a 
large microservices system up and running, focusing on utilising Azure Functions 
and API Management Gateway, and touch upon the learning curve that working with 
these unfamiliar technologies had on the growing team.
