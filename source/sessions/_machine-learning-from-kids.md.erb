An intro to AI talk with a difference: told through stories, stories about the experiences of young children in the schools that Iâ€™ve worked with.

I have run lessons in many schools, introducing students aged 7 and up, to the principles of artificial intelligence and machine learning and more importantly, the impact that these technologies have on their lives.

I've worked with dozens of schools and code clubs to develop child-friendly STEM resources and activities that help children learn about AI through making. In developing and delivering these hands-on sessions, I've supported children to create many different machine learning-powered projects. In all of this, I've been fascinated to see what they've learned from these experiences.

In this talk, I want to share what I've seen. I will demonstrate AI/ML projects made by children - but more importantly, I want to tell you about the lessons they learned from making them.

I think the insights these children gained provide a useful introduction for any developer looking to get started with AI/ML, so if you're new to the field I hope you'll get a useful introduction to how you can get started.
If you already know your way around a machine learning model, I hope you'll find some of the experiences of the next generation interesting!
