As per The Reactive Manifesto, a scalable architecture means seamlessly handing data even when it is being produced chaotically. Comprising components can asynchronously process a large number of events and can also express themselves when they start feeling burdened. This hands-on presentation will cover how the Reactive Streams Specification can be used for implementing modern systems in Java by using Project Reactor. We will have a look at how concepts like Mono/Flux, Subscription and Consumer can become the building blocks for enabling tens-of-millions-of-events-per-second services.
