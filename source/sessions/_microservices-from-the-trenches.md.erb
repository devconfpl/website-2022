“Microservices” is certainly a buzzword. Everybody wants to work on microservices 
applications. However when working on such a project you’ll soon realize that a 
buzzword doesn’t magically make your application work. And there will be a lot 
of challenges that you’ll face on this journey. During this session I will share 
my experience from the trenches of a microservices project aiming to make developers 
aware of the different challenges they mostly won’t see at conferences. I will 
also try to illustrate my experiences with relevant code samples.
