The next wave of digital disruption is Spatial Computing, an emerging technology that will change how we interact with computers and the physical world, using intelligent edge devices like a HoloLens and other mobile devices. Mainly driven by AI computer vision and advanced sensors, those devices can spatially sense the world around us and make the spatially aware context part of the experience. With technologies like the AR Cloud, a common spatial map can be shared between heterogeneous devices to build connected, collaborative, and cross-platform Metaverse apps where virtual objects anchored in the physical world can be shared across devices and over time with persistence.
During the Spatial Computing era we will also enter the Quantum Computing age. Quantum Computers are still in its infancy with limited Qubits, but Q-Day is coming, the day when Quantum Advantage will be readily available and deprecating todayâ€™s cryptography. Even with the hardware infancy, Quantum-inspired computing (QIC) already provides significant advantages for things like Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO).
In this session Rene will explain the concepts and technologies supporting these transformative computing paradigm changes and will show applied and practical use cases to make these abstracts concepts more feasible.
