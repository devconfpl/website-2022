Do you know Git? I bet you do. I also bet you use it, like 90% of the developers who answered last year’s StackOverflow survey. For sure you know all the basic commands to commit, pull, push... You might even rebase regularly, cherry-pick or bisect whenever it’s needed. Good for you, it’s not what this talk will be about! In this talk, we’ll focus on the rest of Git. The forgotten bits of trivia, the little-known, not-for-everyday commands. You won’t leave with much to apply directly in your terminal, but with plenty to talk about on your company’s messaging platform! We’ll jump from Git’s history to its core data structure, passing by some useful commands that you won’t resist trying out for yourself. If that sounds like fun to you, come on in!
