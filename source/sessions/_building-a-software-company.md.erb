Ever wonder what being an independent software consultant is like - or better yet, have you ever wanted to be one? Does getting your own business off the ground seem intimidating or difficult? How about finding and managing clients - and most importantly, getting paid? How do you keep the IRS and the government happy?

And between all of that, how do you find time to do what you were hired to do - build software?

In this session, Spencer breaks down how he started out as a software consultant, from his first side project (earning him $75!) all the way down to his current day-to-day - what he does now, how he got there, and most importantly - the mistakes he made along the way. We'll talk about the nitty gritty of client interaction, estimates, billing, design, and everything in between. We'll also talk about the importance of business structure, payroll, taxes, insurance - the whole nine yards.

Come prepared, because after this sixty minute talk, you'll have all the tools you'll need to start your own consulting business.
