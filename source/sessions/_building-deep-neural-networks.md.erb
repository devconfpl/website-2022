Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Theano. There are numerous ways to build deep neural networks in Python to accomplish amazing tasks such as computer vision, voice assistance and much more.

But what about in .NET? Let's explore that!

Join me in this session where we'll explore the ins and outs of deep learning and neural networks. We'll take a deep dive in to the hot open-source, cross-platform library ML.NET and build our own convolutional neural network in C# using the very latest release.

Attendees will leave with a thorough understanding of deep learning and hands-on experience accomplishing it in .NET/C#
