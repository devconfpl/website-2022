REST APIs aren't dead - in fact they're more alive than ever. Don't let the hype 
around GraphQL put you off - RESTful APIs are being built and used by developers 
all over the world and that isn't changing anytime soon.

Before you start with File > New Project, however, there are some key decisions 
to be made about your API. Who is the main consumer? How will you authenticate? 
Who will own the documentation? How will you test it? How will you deploy it?

In other words, how will you manage the (probably very long) lifecycle of your 
REST API?

Join Spencer as he walks you through some of the decision making processes that 
you'll go through when building a REST API from the ground up. He'll offer 
advice as a designer of REST APIs of all shapes and sizes, for many different 
kinds of consumers, and share some of the many lessons learned over the years. 
Finally, we'll walk through some of the technical considerations you'll make 
when your developers finally sit down and start developing your API.
