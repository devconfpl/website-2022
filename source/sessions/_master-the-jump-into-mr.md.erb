In this session, you will get a glimpse of the mixed reality spectrum and get tips & tricks on how to get into this space. As a game developer, you may have already mastered the essential skills for making PC, mobile, and console games, and you are probably familiar with working with programmers, designers, and 3D artists. The game changer here is what tools support your journey into AR/VR/MR. Cross-platform tools like Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) and StereoKit make this jump a little easier. Learn how this free, Microsoft-driven, open-source project can kick start your MR exploration with an enhanced volumetric UX / UI system and pre-defined components that accelerate cross-platform development in Unity.
