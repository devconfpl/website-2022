Star Wars.  Minority Report. The Good Doctor. Ready Player One. Back to the 
Future. Hollywood has shown us visions of the future for years. Some of 
those visions are coming to life today, and it's changing the way we view 
the world... literally. Join me as I show you what mixed reality is, how it 
will change the future, why we have to be careful with it, and how you can 
get started with it today.
