Developing software based on micro services architecture is extremely easy when you use spring boot and spring cloud. Just throw in a few lines of code and you can have a micro service up and running. But when you have many micro services itâ€™s not easy to run and maintain all of them locally, so you use a central deployment. But if all developers do it, how can they work simultaneously on the same central spring cloud environment and still not interrupt each other? In this talk, I will you show you how and boost your productivity along the way.
