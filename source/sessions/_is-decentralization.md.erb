We live in times of rapid technology development. Each year brings a new portion of widely discussed "breakthroughs", and the ones that get most attention are about decentralization (of processing/control/data storage). Within just few years we've went through hypes related to: blockchain, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, distributed ledgers, NFTs, DIDs, FLoC, web3, etc.

The excitement is widespread, but there's also sound criticism. Some claim that these are solutions to non-existing problems, or - at least - the same problems can be solved in a simpler, cheaper, and faster way.

Why don't we take a closer look then? No, the idea is not to investigate the energy consumption of bitcoin mining or determine whether crypto is an investment or a form of gambling. Let's take two steps back to understand the true nature of the problems decentralization promises to solve - maybe there's indeed a better way? A sample of projects to take a look at are: digital identity, decentralized currencies & payments, unambiguous connections between physical and digital entities, personal data ownership, auditable facts.
