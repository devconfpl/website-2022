Chaos Engineering is methodology that experiments on a distributed system 
in order to build confidence that the system will work well in production. 
Essentially, we experiment by trying to break our system to uncover system 
weakness.

In this talk, Paul will cover the basics of Chaos Engineer, give some case 
studies of companies that currently do this in production and give an 
introduction to some of the open source tooling that currently exists so 
that you can maybe try this at your company. Paul will also show that, by 
following good infrastructure management practices, that you can recover 
and scale the system when necessary, easily!
