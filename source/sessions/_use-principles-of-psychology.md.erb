We make software for humans. So we must understand how humans work to design the best software possible. We don't need to be psychologists or anthropologists, but we do need to know a few things about what makes users do what they do when it comes to software. So come to this session, where you'll learn how to apply critical thinking to developing software solutions and designing digital products. You'll learn about what makes users behave in certain ways and how you can design software with those behaviors and biases in mind. With this knowledge you can provide the best possible experience while you meet your goals. Bonus: It's not just the users' behaviors and biases we need be concerned with. You'll learn how those same behaviors and biases can affect the productivity and functioning of your team - from communications to meetings to code. And how to properly mitigate them.
