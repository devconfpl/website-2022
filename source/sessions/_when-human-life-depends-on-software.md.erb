Most of developers work on web, mobile or desktop applications, but in today's 
world software is everywhere - also in aeroplanes, space shuttles, medical 
equipment or nuclear power plants. How software development in these fields 
differs from everyday applications? How developer's work looks like when he 
must comply with restrictive regulations? During my talk I will answer these 
questions using my experience in the field and references to normative documents. 
I will also analyse some software errors causing loss of human life and 
destroying equipment worth millions of dollars. I hope that this presentation 
will be useful to every developer and will help you to create safer and more 
reliable software.
