Deploying a single container to the Azure is easy; running a mission-critical 
system is not. To run your ever-changing software reliably, you’ll need to think 
ahead about a range of things. For example, controlled deployment and testing 
of not only software but infrastructure as well. How can you use redundancy 
and cut dependencies to make both infrastructure and software resilient to 
failure? What do you do to monitor system health? And how do you protect your 
application’s secrets?

In this talk ‘from-the-trenches’, I’ll show you what you need to know, using 
Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure SQL, Application Insights, and more. I’ll 
explain how we chose to do it, what went wrong and how we fixed it.
