You may have heard development teams talking about the number of deploys they 
make a day or the number of PRs merged a day. You may have heard marketing teams 
talk about the number of page views a day. What do these metrics even mean? 
Are they actually useful to the business as a whole?

In this talk, Paul will debunk the idea of “vanity” metrics and why using these 
as a guide to success has only one outcome. This is a talk intended for all 
parts of an organisation to really help understand what metrics can do for us 
and why a metric may not mean what you believe it does

Behind every vanity metric is a real metric that can help us understand the 
health of our company - whether it be the ability to understand our users or 
the ability to understand the value of a feature

We just need to step back and think about what it actually is…
