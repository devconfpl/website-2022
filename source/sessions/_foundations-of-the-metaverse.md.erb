The MetaVerse is one of the big buzzwords that has been adopted by large tech companies in 2021 to the extend that Facebook's parent company even changed their name to Meta.

A core component of the MetaVerse is ability to precisely locate oneself, real objects and virtual objects in a real environment and to be able to understand that environment.

This session looks at relevant Azure, software, and hardware technologies that help with this task such as Azure Spatial Anchors to enable the MetaVerse.

Microsoft HoloLens 2 will serve as a demonstration device for those technologies.

After this session attendees will have a better understanding of what can enable a MetaVerse that integrates with the real world.
