Do you want to become an infrastructure wizard overnight? Then this talk is for you.

With most tools for Infrastructure as Code, we describe our infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. But there is another way: We can use a general-purpose programming language like TypeScript, Java or C#.

This talk gives an overview of this alternative approach to IaC and answers some of the most burning questions: Can we finally get rid of tons and tons of YAML and JSON files? What are the pros and cons of coding instead of configuring? What tools can we use, what are their differences? And most importantly, do they help us to build infrastructure like a boss without 30 years of experience?
