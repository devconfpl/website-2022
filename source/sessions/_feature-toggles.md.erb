Feature toggles are a great asset to your development workflow - they make 
experimentation and incremental changes easier and help push features through 
faster. But there are potential problems: old flags, unused flags, or worse, 
re-used flags can come and bite you when you are least expecting it.

This talk will cover how to use feature toggles effectively, cover some of 
the horror stories, how they can be avoided, and how to deal with them if 
they do occur. Examples in C#, but applicable everywhere.
