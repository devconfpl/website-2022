The IaC community and ecosystem is going through a major growth phase right now - 
we are no longer limited to just writing config files that grow and are hard to 
change. We are at the point of realising that infrastructure code is just the same 
as application code - it needs the ability to change and adapt to new demands and
requirements. A lot of people are fast starting to understand that the ability to
change fast means bringing software development practices to the fold. This includes
testing, refactoring and continuous integration and delivery.

In this talk, Paul will demonstrate how the emerging trends in the ecosystem is 
allowing us to be able to build our own internal tooling for our companies. These tools allow
us to be well tested, versioned, secure and enable best practices on our users.
