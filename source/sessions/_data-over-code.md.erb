"You are not your code" is oft repeated. The sentiment is invaluable, but 
insufficient. "Your code is not your data", I say! Take a stroll with 
me through some anecdotal projects to learn why you should stop squabbling 
over code techniques and start scrutinizing your data abstractions. For 
that way only shines the light in the tunnel of despair that is our daily 
programming grind.
