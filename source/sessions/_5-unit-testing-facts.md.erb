Getting started with unit tests should be simple â€“ it is just a matter of writing code to test other code. If that is right why so many talented developers fail implementing unit tests in their daily job. I have started using unit tests 8 years ago and failed miserably. It took me 2 years and the right company to start over and learn how to use unit tests and TDD as development tools. However, it was not always clear sailing and as I progresses I found more than my share of pitfalls than blind alleys as well as a fair amount of successes.
In this talk, I will cover the non-trivial facts I learnt over the years about unit testing and the tips that I use to this day.
