The title of this talk sounds like a quote you would attribute to some ancient 
philosopher, or perhaps something taken off a motivational poster. When it 
comes to mixed reality and holograms, persistence is really where the magic 
starts to happen in your brain.  First we are going to explore why that is.  
Second we will talk about why solving the problem digitally is interesting. 
Third we will discuss the tools that can be used to make digital content persistent.  
Finally, we will talk about using persistence responsibly.
