In 2019 we found ourselves in a situation where we needed to produce a huge amount of data to be injected into a Kafka cluster so it can be consumed by an application and run a load testing. Data should follow a defined structure in AVRO format; and also should have certain values in order to follow some Bussiness logics. We didnÂ´t find anything in the market which match our requirements, so we started to build an solution which is easily integrated in JMeter.
