In Shedul/Fresha: we’re not doing Scrum, we’re not using a commodity 
language / development platform, our architecture is neither a monolith nor 
micro-services, we don’t have HR / Recruitment dept or even formal “bosses”. 
We’re not following any hype or re-inventing everything from scratch either. 
And despite all these NOTs, we’re a serious engineering bunch on a continuously 
raising curve (for 4 years already), having a consistent exponential growth 
(business activity volume) month-to-month. How come?

Instead of copying unicorns, we’ve started with very simple solutions & are 
applying self-disciplined Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) to adjust them to 
our local needs, specifics & conditions. That’s how Triumvirate was born, 
that’s why we use Elixir, put our Architecture under Scalpel, follow the 
Bossless style of ownership, put everyone’s Skin in the Game, found our 
Hedgehog Concept, etc.

The purpose of this talk is to convince you that copying 1:1 what has worked 
for other companies does not make sense, neither does mindlessly following 
consultants’ “best practices”. What works much better is building high 
internal awareness of your work, measuring what matters & continuously 
learning (& improving!) via series of small, time-bound experiments. This 
thesis will be backed up with the series of “war-story” examples of how 
we’ve evolved something towards (usually) the better in a sometimes very 
un-obvious way :)
