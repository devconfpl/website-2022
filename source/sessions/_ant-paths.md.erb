The fundaments of nations and society are shifting in the foot steps of 
technological evolution. What will this mean for humanity as a race?

We are on the cusp of a new evolutional stage - the post human age of the 
netocratic dividual where social networks determines your status and the 
tribe surplants the nation state as the defacto seat of power.

How will this change us, both as people and profession, and how does one 
lead when no-one really knows where we're going?
