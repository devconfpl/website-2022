Do you believe political correctness and empathy are buzzwords that limit the 
society rather than contribute to its advancement? Do you think talking about 
topics like diversity quotas, privilege doesnâ€™t make much sense and you would 
rather spend this time talking about the latest in technology?

In this talk I would like to take the chance to try and add the missing 
contexts to such terms and arguments, moreover, I will try to go through 
various examples on how it can impact your product from a very pragmatic 
prospective.
