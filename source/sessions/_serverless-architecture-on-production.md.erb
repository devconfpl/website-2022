Serverless computing or FaaS is one of the most popular areas in the cloud 
nowadays. That is because if it delivers what it promises, we are looking at 
the next big thing. But, is it the case? As someone who has experienced how 
Serverless/FaaS has evolved in the last three years, I’ll talk about how it 
all started and where it is going now. There will be some fun and real cases 
where Serverless caused us problems and empowered us going faster. After 
sharing some of my experiences, we’ll try to answer or get even more 
confused on the future of Serverless!
