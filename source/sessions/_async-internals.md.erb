In this talk I show some internals of exceptions. Examples are based on typical 
use cases and common mistakes. I show why calling async methods synchronously 
might be a bad idea, how to catch out of band exceptions or how to implement 
synchronization mechanisms to wait for async void. We know that we should have 
“async all the way” but very often we are forced to have some trickery because 
of frameworks we use.
