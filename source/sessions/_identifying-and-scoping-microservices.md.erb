The talk starts out setting the stage by a brief discussion of the 3 benefits 
microservices can bring, which is all about the flexibility the business gains 
through short lead times, ability to experiment and ability to scale. The main 
part of the talk is arund 3 concrete rules of thumb that guide decisions around 
what the responsibility of a microservice should be and a whether new ones should 
be introduced. Each rule is explained used examples I have encountered in real 
life projects. The 3 rules are

1. The primary driver for scoping microservices is business capabilities
2. The secondary driver for scoping microservices is technical capabilities
3. The tertiary driver for scoping microservices is effieciency of work

Using these 3 rules, in my experience, leads to microservices that allows us 
to realize the benefits of microservices.

To round things off I explain tactics for for fixing the scopes of services 
when we get then wrong. Again there is good rule of thumb to follow, namely 
that when in doubt error on the side of slightly too large. I will show why 
this is a sane rule to follow.
