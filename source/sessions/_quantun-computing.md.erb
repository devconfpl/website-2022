Quantum Computing is coming. Or is it already here? People say it has the 
potential to completely change the world, but will it? When? How?

In case you haven’t heard, quantum computing is an emerging field that uses 
a quantum system, like the spin of an electron, to do a very specific type 
of math. Until recently, they had only been theorized, but advances in physics 
and engineering have caused rapid advances in the field. There are no fewer 
than a dozen companies working on quantum hardware and control, and probably 
twice that working on algorithms and practical applications (to say nothing of 
the many, many, academic labs that have been working on these problems for decades).

Every few months, someone claims a larger, more powerful device. Promises of 
“quantum supremacy,” the death of RSA, and a complete paradigm shift are on 
the horizon. How much should you, as a random technically-inclined person, 
care about all of this anyway? What do you need to know, and what can you 
just leave to the experts for now? What can you leave to the experts forever?

We’ll answer seven main questions: 

1. How do quantum computers actually work? (qubits, algorithms, destructive interference, and the lie of “probability”) 
2. What are quantum computers actually good for? (We don’t fully know yet, but chemistry, prime factoring, but not “trying every answer at once”) 
3. What will quantum computers never be good at? (More than you think!) 
4. How do you build a quantum computer? (there are more ways than one!) 
5. Has anyone built a working quantum computer? How powerful is it? (yes; it’s complicated) 
6. What’s next? How soon? (or, why Quantum Supremacy isn’t that important after all) 
7. If you want to go deeper, where should you go for more resources?

We won’t be covering: 

* How quantum algorithms work at a detailed level 
* The physics/math of why these things work.

Who should attend: 

Anyone who is curious (or scared, or excited) about quantum computing, but 
doesn’t know much yet. Maybe you’ve read a few articles on Wired or Gizmodo, 
maybe they’ve left you with more questions than answers. No prior knowledge 
of physics, quantum computing, or advanced mathematics necessary. A basic 
familiarity with how classical (“regular”) computers work is helpful, 
but not required.

What you’ll leave with: 

A more comprehensive knowledge of quantum computing, both from a big-picture—history, 
major players, practical utility, progress, what’s next — and a nuts-and-bolts—qubits, 
algorithms, hardware—perspective. You’ll be able to say “yes!” when your boss asks 
if you know anything about this quantum computing thing, be able to not only 
understand, but critically evaluate announcements and headlines about quantum 
computing, and if you want, a bevy of resources for going deeper into this emerging field.
