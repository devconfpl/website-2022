Picture this: you're a senior engineer at your company who, one day, is thrust 
into the architect role. Suddenly, you're having to think about things that 
you've never thought about - what's the difference between a microservice and 
a service bus? How do I design a scalable system for tomorrow without 
overengineering today?

Better yet, if you're at a startup, do all that - and still be responsible for 
code reviews, development, and coaching of junior devs. How can a fledgling 
architect possibly "do it all" - and more importantly, do it well?

Luckily, someone has gone down that path (and is still going)... and he's ready 
to share his story.

Attend Spencer's talk and hear about how he, as a senior engineer, had to grow 
into the architect role. We'll discuss the problems faced, the critical 
"decision points" he made from an architecture standpoint, the results of those 
choices, and how he helped guide the business through three architectural 
rewrites - all in a span of four years!
