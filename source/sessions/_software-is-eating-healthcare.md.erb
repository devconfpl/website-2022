Healthcare is transforming in new and unexpected ways. What was once a sleepy industry is being driven to change by a number economic, technological, and demographic mega trends.

This talk will unpack the ways in which software is transforming one of the worldâ€™s largest industries and the underlying forces driving this change. It will look at how hospitals are being unbundled into distributed software-enabled care services that may not look anything like what we think of as healthcare today.

We explore these underlying mega trends and the implications as well as opportunities for us as technologists to create enormous value in this space.
