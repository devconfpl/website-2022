"Multicloud" is, like "Agile", "DevOps", and similar, yet another word that has been misused in countless contexts and discussions.
Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to take part to several large migrations of core systems used by millions of people across multiple industries. From Banking to Fashion, passing by Retail, Media, and of course Software industries I had the pleasure to work with extremely talented people focused on migrations and transformations.
Data Migrations; Lift-and-Shifts; Monoliths on classic datacenters being broken down into microservices on public clouds; microservices on public clouds being brought back on on-prem private clouds; cross cloud-vendors migrations; and so on.

We came to the conclusion that multicloud is not only possible but it is also a state that needs to be reached by any business that seeks leadership in a specific sector or industry and for key organizations and institutions that needs to keep their independence.

In this talk I will set the scene through specific case studies and stories from the frontlines;
I will then give our opinionated definition of what multicloud actually is and then we will explain why reaching this stage is key to having well-architected systems.
We found that Domain-Driven Design in tandem with Ports & Adapters Architecture helps especially well in such situations, so we will bring specific patterns and examples on why this is the case.
Finally, we will discuss one main pain that will come after the first success, governance, and cross-pollination. How to do this at scale without choking the Center of Excellence? We came up with what we think is a novel approach to Strategic Design that we called Fractal Architectures.
