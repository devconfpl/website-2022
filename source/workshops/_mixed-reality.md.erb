If you are curious about XR and familiar with Unity, this hands-on workshop will give you a practical introduction to mixed reality development. With expert assistance, you'll create a functional virtual showroom using the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). MRTK is a free, open source project driven by Microsoft that provides a set of UX building blocks and components to accelerate MR development across devices based on OpenXR. By the end of this workshop, you'll deploy your project to a HoloLens 2 or Meta Quest. All lab materials and sample application will be available after the workshop for your continued learning.

**Prerequisites:** 

Basic familiarity with Unity: interface, scene creation, package import, the addition of Game Objects to a scene. Laptops (with all tools installed) and HoloLens 2 devices will be provided for use during this workshop. If youâ€™d prefer to deploy to a Meta Qwest, please bring your device with you.

**Note:**

This is not a full day workshop - rather 3-4 hours long. Also the attendance is free of charge (0 PLN).
