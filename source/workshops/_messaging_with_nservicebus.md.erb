Go beyond the hype and build a solid foundation of theory and practice with 
this workshop on message-oriented architecture and development.

**Topics:**

Join Jimmy Bogard for a deep dive covering architectural topics like:

* UI decomposition
* Data ownership across the enterprise
* Finding service boundaries

You’ll also learn the nitty-gritty details of building production-ready 
systems including:

* Fault tolerance – HTTP and queues
* Reliable integration with 3rd party systems
* Scalability, high availability & monitoring

Finally, get some hands-on experience in message-oriented architectures 
by building:

* Scalable command-processing endpoints
* Publish/subscribe event-processing interactions
* Long-running multi-stage business processes and policies

We’ll understand messaging concepts, and DDD concepts such as bounded 
contexts and data ownership.

We’ll apply those concepts to build a simple, yet fully functional, order 
management system sample with a messaging architecture, using patterns such 
as command processing, pub/sub and long-running sagas.

**Who should attend?**

Senior developers, tech leads, and architects will benefit most from this 
workshop.
