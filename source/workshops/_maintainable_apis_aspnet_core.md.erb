This workshop is all about implementing a scalable, testable, and robust 
API solution using ASP.NET Core and C#. We’ll start with the fundamentals 
of API design, including design considerations for a multitude of use cases, 
no matter if you’re creating single-page applications, mobile apps, or 
simply exposing your data for integration. Then, we’ll dive into a series 
of hands-on exercises designed to get you up and running on building APIs 
using ASP.NET Core and C#. Finally, we’ll review essential tools within 
the API development ecosystem that are designed to help you test, maintain, 
deploy, and document your API - all in just a couple of days!
From the developer who’s never worked with an API (or an API of that kind 
for any matter!) to a seasoned API developer, this workshop will have something 
for everyone! Come prepared to learn and practice implementing an API that can be used to back systems of all kinds.
