Understand the concepts of DDD but feeling overwhelmed to implement? 
Feeling overwhelmed by complex examples and can't connect how to implement 
DDD in your project? Looking for more concrete guidance on the concepts and 
principles of DDD and want to learn how to connect it to real-world code?

If this sounds familiar, then this workshop is for you. We cover both the 
theory and patterns of Domain-Driven Design, and connect it to code with 
hands-on examples in .NET 6.

* Where DDD fits in to software delivery and what business problems it addresses
* When to use DDD and when not to use it
* How to craft and enforce a ubiquitous language
