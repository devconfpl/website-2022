Building Cloud Native application is a thing now. Everyone talks about it, 
everyone wants to do it. Thanks to organizations like Cloud Native 
Computing Foundation (CNCF) and new tools coming out every month, Cloud 
Native is starting to be reality not just an idea.

Now all we need to do is to catch up! And the best way to start catching up 
is to learn about Kubernetes – first tool that came out from CNCF. 
Kubernetes is a new way of orchestrating containers, helping developers 
concentrate on the code, not on the ops.

During the workshop you will learn why you should consider Kubernetes as your 
next tool in your pipeline. Then we will go through basic concepts of 
Kubernetes and problems that it solves. And we will finish day with advanced 
subjects like deployments and diagnostics.

During a day you will create Kubernetes cluster locally and in cloud. You will 
deploy your current (monolith-like) as well as new (microservices-like) 
applications to that freshly created cluster. And you will learn how you can 
diagnose what went wrong (as we know if something might go wrong it will).

All of this will help you make better decision about approach to take in yours 
Cloud Native application adventures.

**Topics:**

* Definitions - so we would be on the same page
* Practice, as we know that this is the only way that we will learn
* CLI - how to use definitions in Practice
* More exercises
* YAML - how to use CLI and definitions in powerful combinations that allow us 
to do everything<sup>*</sup>
* Even more exercises
* How to handle unexpected deployment situations <sup>**</sup>

<sup>*</sup> almost<br/><sup>**</sup> with more exercise 

**Who should attend?**

This workshop is addressed to everyone who lacks basic knowledge of Kubernetes – 
what are pods, configmaps, deployments etc.

**Pre-requisites:**

From participants we required a small knowledge about Docker – don’t worry, if 
you are not master at it. All we are asking, is that, that you know what Docker 
is, what container is and what image is. Rest is on us!
