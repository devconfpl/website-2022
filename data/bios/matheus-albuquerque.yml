I'm a Sr. Front-End Engineer building a low-code workspace at Citrix and I also teach front-end development at TechLabs Berlin, an NGO that builds a free platform for people to learn different programming skills.

My areas of interest include JavaScript and compile-to-JS languages, architecture patterns, UI libraries & frameworks, developer tooling, and performance optimization.
