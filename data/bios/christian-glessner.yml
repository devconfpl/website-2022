Christian Glessner is the founder and CEO of Hololux, a leading innovation agency. In an emerging digital world, Christian helps his clients become more successful by using the latest technologies like Serverless Computing, Mixed Reality, and AI.
His parents were entrepreneurs, and he grew up between IT technology and economics. As a kid, he was deeply inspired by the amber, sparkling screen and its blinking and promising cursor of an AS/400 in his parent's office. "Ready" - The "Tabula Rasa", or in other words, the chance of creating something entirely new from scratch, is still driving his passion for information technologies. This year he was honored for the 12th time in a row for receiving the 'Microsoft MVP Award', an Oscar-like accolade conferred by Microsoft.
