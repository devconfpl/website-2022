Garance is a senior engineering manager at @FactorialHR, where she works remotely. Her days are busy leading others to success: in her teams in particular, and in the wider engineering organisation in general. She started her career as a software engineer, and never misses a chance to jump in the console to debug or look at others debugging. When she’s not working, you’ll have better chances finding her hiking in the Pyrenees mountains than in front of a laptop.
